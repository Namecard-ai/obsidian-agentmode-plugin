# Frontend English Language Requirements

This is an Obsidian plugin written in TypeScript/React. All UI text, code comments, and documentation must be in English.

## Language Requirements

### UI Text and Messages
- All user-facing text must be in English
- Error messages should be in English
- Button labels, tooltips, and notifications must be in English
- Console logs and debug messages should be in English

### Code Comments
- All code comments must be written in English
- Function and class documentation should be in English
- TODO comments and inline explanations must be in English

### File and Variable Naming
- Use descriptive English names for variables, functions, and classes
- Follow camelCase convention for TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use clear, self-documenting names

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/React Best Practices
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type definitions
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibility

### Variable Declarations
- **Never use `var`** - always use `const` or `let` instead
- Use `const` for variables that won't be reassigned
- Use `let` for variables that will be reassigned
- `var` has function-level scope which can lead to bugs - modern JavaScript uses block-level scope with `const`/`let`

### Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document component props and their types
- Include usage examples in comments when helpful
